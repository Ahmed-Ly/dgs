# Thisdp's Dx Graphical User Interface System (MTA:SA Dx Lib)

This is a dx gui lib of MTASA that is designed with dx functions. 

Everything is refer to original GUI (gui*). BUT the difference between them is that DGS have a STRONG property system that can freshen your dxgui looks even design the style with shaders by yourself.

Sry for the bad design of default style. But with property system, you can change it into your OWN style.

If you don't want more bugs, Plz let the resource name to be *dgs*.

To know what I have done with dgs, Plz see the update logs, click here: http://angel.mtaip.cn:233/dgsUpdate/

The reason why I release DGS is that I am ready to leave MTA. This is my only one contribution to MTA.

At last, I am glad you to use DGS. And if there is someone want to make it better, just do it, editing the code, adding functions and events......
